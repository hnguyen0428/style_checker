# Style Checker
## cstyle.py
A style checker for C files.

What it can check:

    - [x] Excess white space
    - [x] Lines over 80 characters
    - [x] General indentation
    - [x] "Magic" Numbers
    - [x] Commented out code (most of them)
    
Note: This should only be used as a general guide for styling. The program
will not always be able to catch every styling mistake nor will the
mistakes that it catches always be a styling error.
